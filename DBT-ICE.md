## What is DBT-ICE?

**DBT-ICE (Department of Biotechnology – Integrated Computing Environment)** is a national cloud-based computational facility for bioinformatics, developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) and funded by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India. It provides a scalable and portable platform built on cloud-based distributed computing infrastructure, integrated with big data analytics tools capable of analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.

## Infrastructure Requirements

Since DBT-ICE is a cloud-based platform, it doesn't require extensive on-premise infrastructure. However, to effectively utilize it within a college or institutional setup, the following parameters should be considered:

### 1. Physical Space & Environment
- **Parameter: Server Room Availability**
  - If local auxiliary services (such as internal caching, identity management, or local file storage) are to be hosted, a dedicated server room is recommended.
  - The space should be dust-free and well-ventilated.

- **Parameter: Temperature & Humidity Control**
  - Maintain ambient temperatures between **20°C to 24°C**.
  - Relative humidity should be kept at approximately **50%** to protect equipment from static electricity and overheating.

### 2. Power Supply
- **Parameter: Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS)**
  - Required for ensuring consistent operation of routers, switches, and any local server infrastructure.
  - Suggested backup duration: **30–60 minutes** minimum.

- **Parameter: Backup Generator**
  - For areas with frequent power outages, a diesel or hybrid generator is recommended to maintain uptime during extended outages.

### 3. Networking
- **Parameter: Internet Bandwidth**
  - Recommended minimum: **100 Mbps dedicated leased line**.
  - For higher concurrent users, consider scaling bandwidth proportionally.

- **Parameter: LAN Infrastructure**
  - Gigabit Ethernet switches and CAT6 or higher cabling.
  - High-quality routers with firewall and VLAN support for secure access.

## How Can the College Use DBT-ICE?

### 1. Research and Development
- Enable students and faculty to conduct high-level bioinformatics research using remote cloud resources.
- Analyze large-scale genomic and proteomic datasets without needing local high-performance computing infrastructure.

### 2. Education and Training
- Integrate DBT-ICE into bioinformatics and life sciences curriculum for hands-on learning with real-world data.
- Organize training sessions and workshops to familiarize users with pipelines, tools, and computational workflows.

### 3. Collaborative Projects
- Support inter-institutional research collaborations using shared virtual infrastructure.
- Utilize the platform for national and international projects requiring secure, centralized data processing.
